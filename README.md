# SOBUB - Silence Occasionally Broken Up By

SOBUB is a small and stupid project idea doing exactly what it sounds like.

Inspired by the shitpost Youtube video "[1 hour of silence occasionally broken up by a reverb fard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iY6TpXuRCE&t=1175s)" by [Business Goose](https://www.youtube.com/@BusinessGoose).
